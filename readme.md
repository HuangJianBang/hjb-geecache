hjb-geecache, as you can guess, a very personal repository aims to hone skills of writing codes with Golang. 
geecache is a mini [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache) created by [geektutu](https://geektutu.com/post/geecache.html). 
More information about geecache you can [get here](https://geektutu.com/post/geecache.html).
By the way, this guy used Go 1.13 in the project, that means there will be some issues if you copy his codes completely.
In hjb-geecache, some notes are added and hope it works to you.
